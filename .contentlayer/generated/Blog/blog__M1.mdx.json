Firstly, we need to install a JavaScript Package manager called NodeJS. This will allow us to install React CLI Tools onto our machine. Head  here [https://nodejs.dev/en/] to install NodeJS onto your machine. \r\n\r\nOn the page, download the installer for your machineâ€™s operating system. It will install an executable installer for seamless installation. Once you have opened the installer, follow the on-screen steps to safely install the file onto your machine. NodeJS will then install some packages for you to install dependencies for any JavaScript project you may have. Dependencies are external packages written by other programmers for us to use in our own project. \r\nThese dependencies are stored in NodeJS and each time we can install them into our project without having to write them on our own.\r\n\r\n## React Tool CLI\r\nFinally, we are almost done with setting up our environment for React. We will need to install the final component, which is the React CLI Tools. Before we start developing our React Project, create a new folder within your machine. This folder will be the root directory for your first React App. Open the code editor of your choice and open the built-in terminal. For StackUp web development quests, we will be using Visual Studio Code. Enter the following commands one \r\nby one for React to populate your directory with the templates and other essential tools needed for your React project.\r\n\r\n## Code\r\nnpx create-react-app counter-app\r\n----\r\ncd counter-app\r\n----\r\nnpm run start\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe first line of the command is to generate the boilerplate. React will create a new folder called counter-app in this case. The second command is to change the directory to that new folder and run the last command. The first word: npm means NodeJS Package Manager and for most command line tools, the first word is usually the program or app responsible for that command. The next word: run is the command for that particular program. For this case, it will open the package.json file and find the command called start. This will spin up the local development server to get our React Project going. Do remember that your local development server will need to be running in the background for you to see changes in your browser. \r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\nimages: https://s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1674101785248x809012262460433900/c55q1_s3_eo.png\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
