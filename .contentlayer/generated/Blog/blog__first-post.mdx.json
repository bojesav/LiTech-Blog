I originally built out a Hugo site that auto deployed using AWS, but stopped writing after a few months - mainly out of lack of time and due to self-imposed pressure on having good enough topics. I decided I wanted to learn more about the Next.js ecosystem, and found this starter blog that used Tailwind as well, so I thought it would be a great way to get back into working on something.\n\n## Goals of the blog\n\nThe last time I wrote a blog I tried to stay so focused on life optimization that I sort of failed to build out content after a few articles. I think instead here I'm going to try to write about a few more areas:\n\n- Projects (Both technical and personal/fun things like learning music)\n- General posts (like this one, about life)\n- Technical achievements and learnings\n- Reviews and insights on books/podcasts/etc.\n- Travel and planning information\n- Photography\n\nI'm also hoping to build other non blog features on the site - more to come there!\n",
